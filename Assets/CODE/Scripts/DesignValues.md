# DESIGN VALUES

## 1. Experience (everybody wins heaven)
# What does the player get to do while playing? How does this make them feel physically and emotionally?
Analyze patterns in text to decode messages directed at player hidden in plain sight. All depending on their story-association of each uppercase letter they will be able to decode and form intricate new stories from the messages. Leaving them with a profound sense of insight, which can feel joyous, funny, scary and or shocking, depending on their current emotional state and previously acquired knowledge base.

## 2. Theme (t wins heaven wins heaven t)
# What is the game about? How does it present this to players? What concepts, perspectives or experiences might the player encounter during play? How are these derived? Through story, systems, modelling, metaphor?
The game is about making decisions for the player's and other player's livelihood via the consequences of their choices. Looking at the patterns, the player can choose how to move forward in the game, they can be impacted by the emotional rollercoaster or decide upon a strategic way to apply the newly acquired knowledge for their own growth or that of the many.
Every specific pattern outlines a collection of both nouns(players or teams) or actions(Love, Kill etc) to be taken by the player or be assigned to another player/team
Letting the player add value to themselves, or the team/teams you align with (a choice based on affiliation), or what the player thinks would be best for everyone (a choice based on the players preferences).
All combinations allow space for protection for those who need it most, as well as confusion via the communicated understanding of the players understanding of the hidden meaning and assigned meaning with multiple options on all identifiers (Love, Life, Lesbian, Kill, King, U/you, Unity, Understand)

## 3. Point Of View (people of value win fail stay)
# What does the player feel see or hear? From what cultural reference point?How is the game and the information within it represented? Simple graphics, stylized geometric shapes, highly detailed models?
Example of a pattern... Aware players see names of artists and songs on a playlist, which could be interpreted based on their case type. Also listening to the songs with an intonation towards some words highlighting the letter it starts with, which does not always match the theme of the song, which is a highly detailed model hidden in plain sight.
Cultural references touch on topics such as sexuality, gender, compassion, depression, religion, blame, privacy, sexism, suicide, lack of privacy, learning, introspective. Various teams will have opinions which can be opposing to one another causing friction, or is there a better way, one where we find unity?

Challenge presents itself in, the initial interpretation of the messages, followed by the impact of the choices needed to attain the best outcome.

## 5. Decision Making (d marc heaven heaven i)
# How and where do players make decisions? How are decisions presented? Is the information space perfect or imperfect?
Challengingly all players can blame other teams, go solo against everyone, join only the teams that think like them, or dig deeper for the best outcome for everyone. Great options, patterns and teams allows us to challenge the way we think and demonstrate both compassion and interests, while empowering the player to do things differently. While attaining the attention of the players via various mediums such as story and media, decisions can be represented while hidden in plain sight. With the information space being perfect.
